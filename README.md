⚙️ How to Use

Launch the App: Open tracker.html in the web browser.

Add a Transaction:

Enter a description for the transaction (e.g., "salary," "groceries").

Enter the amount. Use a positive number for income (e.g., 50000) and a negative number for expenses (e.g., -3000).

Click the Add Income or Add Expense button.

View Your History: Your new transaction will appear in the history list.

Delete a Transaction: Click the ❌ button next to any transaction to remove it.

Check Your Balance: Your total balance, income, and expenses will automatically update.

💻 Technologies Used

HTML: Provides the foundational structure of the application.

CSS: Styles the user interface, ensuring a clean and responsive design.

JavaScript: Powers the dynamic functionality, including DOM manipulation, data handling, and local storage integration.

💡 How It Works

The application utilizes JavaScript to manage and manipulate data. When you add a new transaction, it's saved in a JavaScript array and synchronized with your browser's local storage. This ensures data persistence. The app then dynamically updates the displayed balance, income, and expense totals. When you delete a transaction, it's removed from both the on-screen list and local storage, ensuring your data remains accurate and up to date.

📝 Important Note

This application saves data locally to your browser. If you clear your browser's cache or local storage, your transaction history will be permanently deleted.
